# neural-network-model
A simple neural network model trained to do a variety of tasks.

## How does the first neural network work?
> The Nueral Network uses the library [Synapic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) for computing value's and backpropagating weights/bias's in JavaScript.

## How does the math work for [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)?
> This [website by Matt Mazur](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/) shows some of the functions and example values for backpropagating a neural network and it's weights/bias, it's useful for understanding how it works.

## How did I learn to do the second neural network?
> [giant_neural_network](https://www.youtube.com/@giantneuralnetwork/featured) on YouTube has a very beginner freiendly [playlist for learning neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxt59R_fWVzT9bDxA76AHm3ig0Gg9S3So) that I used to make the second neural network. 

### How to use the app?
> First, run this
```
$ git clone https://github.com/seanderenas/neural-network-model.git
```
> Continue on with 
```
$ npm install 
```
> Lastly, start the server with 
```
$ node .\src\server.js
```
This should downlaod the files, initialize & installl node_modules, and start the server at localhost:3000
