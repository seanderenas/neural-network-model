# neural-network-model
A simple neural network model trained to do a variety of tasks.

## How does it work?
> The Nueral Networks use <a href='https://github.com/cazala/synaptic' target='_blank'>Synapic</a> for computing value's and bias's in JS.

## How does the math work?
> This <a href='https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/' target='_blank'>website by Matt Mazur</a> shows some of the functions and example values for a Nueral Network.

### How to run the app?
> First, run this
```
$ git clone https://github.com/seanderenas/neural-network-model.git
```
> Continue on with 
```
$ npm install 
```
> Lastly, start the server with 
```
$ node .\src\server.js
```
This should downlaod the files, initialize & installl node_modules, and start the server at localhost
